# TimeSeriesCBM
Practical Concept Bottleneck Model for Time Series

## Installation
You'll need to locally install a reference to the `txai` package, which contains commonly-used utilities, model architectures, and training procedures. To install, navigate to the base directory `*/TimeSeriesCBM/` and run:
```
python -m pip install -e .
```
This should install the references that you need to run scripts in the `experiments` directory.
